#Enhanced Tic-Tac-Toe Console Game with Min-Max AI Algorithm
The "Enhanced Tic-Tac-Toe Console Game" is a remarkable project that emerged from an Object Oriented Programming course, showcasing an innovative fusion of classic gameplay and cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI). This console application offers players an immersive experience through single and multiplayer modes, complemented by adjustable difficulty settings, all driven by the formidable Min-Max AI Algorithm.

Gameplay and Modes:
This project modernizes Tic-Tac-Toe with single/multiplayer modes, catering to different preferences and skill levels. The "Easy" and "Hard" modes accommodate players, with the Min-Max AI Algorithm providing an engaging challenge.

Min-Max AI Algorithm for Unbeatable Hard Difficulty:
At the heart of the "Enhanced Tic-Tac-Toe Console Game" is the implementation of the Min-Max AI Algorithm for the hard difficulty level. The AI opponent, utilizing the Min-Max algorithm, evaluates all possible moves and outcomes to make optimal decisions, ensuring that players face a formidable challenge. In this mode, players will find it nearly impossible to secure a victory against the AI, as it excels in strategic gameplay. The hard difficulty AI is meticulously crafted to never lose, guaranteeing either a draw or a victory for the computer. This showcases the depth of AI intelligence and provides an opportunity for players to test their mettle against an unbeatable adversary.

Designing Excellence: Object-Oriented Principles
